# nmap-scan
This Python code is a simple script that uses the nmap tool to scan a target IP address or domain for open ports and services. Below is a detailed breakdown of what the code does:

Code Walkthrough and Description
1. Importing Required Modules
python
Copy code
import os
The os module is imported to allow interaction with the operating system.
In this script, it’s used to execute a system command (nmap) directly from the Python program.
2. Defining the nmap_scan Function
python
Copy code
def nmap_scan(target):
    command = f"nmap -sV {target}"
    os.system(command)
Purpose: This function runs an nmap scan on a given target.
Parameters:
target: This is the IP address or domain name to be scanned.
How It Works:
The function constructs an nmap command string using Python’s f-string formatting: nmap -sV {target}.
nmap: A powerful network scanning tool.
-sV: This option enables service detection. It scans open ports to determine what services are running and their versions.
os.system(command): Executes the nmap command in the system’s shell, displaying the scan results in the console.
3. Main Program Execution
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    target = input("Enter target IP/Domain: ")
    nmap_scan(target)
Purpose: This part ensures that the script runs as a standalone program and does not execute if imported as a module.
Steps:
Input Prompt:
The script asks the user to enter a target IP address or domain name.
input("Enter target IP/Domain: ") captures this information and assigns it to the variable target.
Calling the Function:
The script passes the user-provided target to the nmap_scan function, triggering the scan.
How the Script Works in Practice
The user runs the script in a Python environment.
The script prompts the user to enter a target (e.g., an IP like 192.168.1.1 or a domain like example.com).
The nmap_scan function executes the nmap command with the -sV option, targeting the provided IP or domain.
The os.system function runs the nmap command in the system shell, displaying the results directly in the terminal.
Example Use Case
If a user enters 192.168.1.1 as the target, the script runs the following command:
bash
Copy code
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
This will scan 192.168.1.1 to identify open ports and detect services along with their versions.
Considerations
Prerequisites:
The system must have nmap installed and available in the system's PATH.
Security Implications:
The script executes a potentially sensitive operation. Scanning networks without permission is unethical and may be illegal. Always ensure you have explicit authorization before running scans.
Limitations:
The script doesn’t process or save the scan results; they are displayed in the terminal.
It lacks error handling for cases like invalid target input or nmap not being installed.
Potential Enhancements
Error Handling: Add checks to validate the target or confirm that nmap is installed.
Result Parsing: Use Python to capture and analyze the scan results for further processing.
Advanced Features: Extend the script to include additional nmap options, such as -A for OS detection or -Pn for no ping scans.
This script serves as a simple but powerful starting point for learning how to integrate network scanning tools with Python.
